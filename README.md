# Servivce-Recovery
The story of Dana is the story of the Auto towing recovery and mobile truck cranes, Heavy Equipment in the U.A.E. Established in 1990, Dana began as a small, unknown organization in Abu Dhabi, in a remote corner of the country. Gradually the company grew to become U.A.E’s top auto towing recovery and crane rental provider. From the earliest starting point, Dana’s policy was to give quality machinery for society’s changing needs. We at Dana believe that machines exist to serve people and so our equipment must profit not only the company itself, but also our community, and the environment we all share.
